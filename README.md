# Fair-index-count



This function initializes arrays to store prefix sums of A and B. Then, it iterates through each index K, calculates the left and right sums for both arrays, and checks if the conditions for fairness are met. If they are, the total count of fair indexes is incremented. Finally, the total count is returned.
